Before we proceed with the installation process
I just want to say that 
I apologize if it took a while; I have currently a work and can only coding in the evening.

I had an issue with installing Laravel 8 and Vue JS. The issue was about a missing library that Vite JS was looking for. So, I installed Laravel 10, and there were no problems. I am using MySQL with XAMPP.

I am using Laravel's built-in login function. I also installed ui vue --auth to have controllers for authentication. I have also created a seeder for the product, and it contains 10 entries.
I haven't been able to use router-view and router-link, but my components for the product are in Vue. 

Please check, thank you very much.

1. Clone the Repo
    a. update the repo (composer and npm)
2. Import the sql named (backendexam.sql)
3. update the .env
4. You can now seed
5. artisan optimize
6. serve and run dev
